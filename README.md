# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
    The goals of this exercise were to familiarize ourselves with the process of getting and working with data from several differnt APIs, and then how to visualize, clean, and analyse the data in a meaningful way. Finally, I think time management skills, working with Markdown in Jupyter to make our reports a bit better visually than the first project, and building a functional presentation are goals.

## Process
### Gathering this data took more than 80% of the time. First, City Bikes, then Yelp, then FourSquare.
### Put some thought into how to use the data once you could access it, formulate questions, and execute them.

## Results
There was far more data available in Helsinki Finland in the FourSquare API. More than 6x more results were obtained, which was also significantly more data based on Wilcoxon paired t-tests among results within 100m, 250m, 350m, and 500m.

## Challenges 
The challenge was in time management. This data took so long to pull that I was certain I would not complete the project. As well, because of the programming test which took most of the day on Friday, we were not able to take advantage of AR assistance on one of the days when we really needed it (Sunday) and only for limited times on Saturday as well. Working with the data and running the analyses paled in time committment to gathering the data and preparing the documents to communicate what was done with it.

## Future Goals
I was a bit disappointed by this dataset. The City Bikes data was really cool, I thought, and maybe with different data from some other sources it would have been a lot more fun to work with. Perhaps gathering data from more than one city and comparing the number of stations to city size, country populations and cultural differences, health, etc. But, let's face it, for the amount of time we had to take a run at this data, any really truly in-depth analysis would likely have been impossible. In my professional life, though one would never work on the same project continually the entire time, it would often take 3-6 months to get any kind of workable manuscript from the time you laid your eyes on the data to the time you sent your first draft for review.
